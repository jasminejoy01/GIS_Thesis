The Niagara Region GO Train Expansion Project was a project that Geospatial Niagara facilitated between Richard Quodomine of Local Point Technologies & Consulting Ltd. and Niagara College GIS/Geospatial Management Program.
The fundamental basis for carrying out this project was that there were inadequate direct public transit services between Hamilton and Niagara regions. 
However, there was a lot of potential for GO Transit to meet the needs of many frequent travellers/users/commuters to the region (i.e. working professionals, students) who found it difficult to travel to and from the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area (GTHA) to Niagara region without a vehicle. 
Furthermore, there was also a great economic opportunity for GO Transit to capitalize on the tourism industry in the Niagara region (a key economic sector) and could even provide a more cost effective alternative to VIA rail for frequent riders (especially through reduced rates with the Presto Card).
The goal of this project was to determine the ridership potential between the GTHA and Niagara region, and to further identify the return-on-investment for increasing no-build route alternatives (i.e. utilizing existing rail tracks and determining new bus routes) servicing between those regions. 
The possibilities of implementing this project would improve the business environment by inviting and attracting more prospects for economic growth and development into this region. 
On achieving this goal, the government (and Metrolinx) can provide the appropriate services to link communities between the GTHA and the Niagara regions (for those without a vehicle). 
It would also alleviate traffic congestions on the QEW thereby reducing carbon emissions and creating a more sustainable environment.

The thesis project was completed as a part of the GIS/Geospatial Management Post-Graduate Certification Program at Niagara College.
Tasks undertaken:
• Data acquisition from open sources & institutions;
• Mathematical modelling and forecast of ridership;
• Data processing and analysis;
• Cost-profit estimations from available financial statements of Metrolinx and VIA Rail;
• Quantifying the cost of qualitative factors like carbon emission, fuel and time costs from congestion estimation.
